# The Step Brothers Are Back 
*By Willie Hicks - May 11, 2025*

Starlito and Don Trip dropped real underground gospel with this one. Ain’t no playlist placements, no big rollout — just fire.

## Why This Drop Matters

Outside of those that know, this wasn't even a wide rollout besides the promo that they did on their own. As a fan of this duo since '09 I will say I do love the fact that they receive their flowers from those who truly appreciate their artistry.  


The *"Step Brothers"*, Starlito and Don Trip are back with the fourth installment of their Step Brothers' project. The well-awaited and anticipated musical masterpiece couldn't have come at a more perfect time. For them to have evolved in this game over the years, they still bring the same tenancity and wity bars that we know they are famous for. 
This includes hits like hits like "Royal Rumble" which is a take on their "Out Takes" from the original Step Brothers where they deliver clever bars over constant beat switches in a tag-team formant. Music so good even their production samples their old music where we get a nod to the past from *"Funerals & Court Dates"* on Still Lost which samples the iconic and melodivc whistle we loved from "Lost". Their chemistry is undoubtabley one of the best duos of the generation with how they are able to feed off one another effortless. 
Song's like "But I" often let you see a different perspective of the two artists and their views on personal relations featuring Robin Ranyelle who has appeared on many tracks for Lito over the years.

Overall, this tape gives me vibes of Step Brothers 2. More refined, more polished, but keen to details like the cover art including their children to production even used that incorporates relationships forged over the years for some of their prior hits. This project shows the evolution of a dynamic duo and once again, the Step Brothers have provided a timeless gem.

*More to come...*
